Assignment:
A palindrome is a word that reads the same forwards as backwards. The words tot, madam and racecar are palindromes; the words tote and Racer are not.

Complete the PalindromeTestWrapper method so that it reads a string from the user, calls isPalindrome to determine if it is a palindrome and displays an appropriate message. Your program must allow the user to repeatedly enter strings.

Complete the isPalindrome method so that it returns true if s is a palindrome and false if it isnâ€™t. You must use a stack in your solution algorithm.  You must use the Java API class util.Stack<E> in your coding.
